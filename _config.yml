 bio: "I started wildlife photography at the age of twelve. And the inspiration to start doing this was by watching Austin Stevens, an honestly really bad photographer. But, my inspiration continued when I started waking up at four Oâ€™clock in the spring and summer to go and photograph anything I could find. And eventually I was getting up early almost every day, than I started watching videos on wildlife photography and learned some photography tricks specifically for wildlife. These certainly assisted my photography."
